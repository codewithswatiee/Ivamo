        images: ["/+91/1.png"],
    about:  `Plus 91 Perfumes was born from a challenge to the status quo. In a market where fine fragrances are reserved for special occasions and luxury labels dominate the conversation, +91 set out to democratize the perfume experience — making it accessible, expressive, and unmistakably Indian. \n\n
            IVAMO Studios partnered with the founders to bring this ambition to life through a complete brand creation. From name to narrative, from packaging to digital design, every element was built to channel confidence, color, and character. The mission was clear: create a perfume brand that doesn’t whisper refinement but speaks boldly of individuality and everyday luxury.
            The visual language is unapologetically playful yet polished. A vibrant color system, dynamic typography, and kinetic motion graphics reflect the pulse of modern Indian youth — expressive, curious, and proud of their identity. The packaging system for all eight perfumes extends this energy into tangible form. Each scent carries its own personality, with storytelling that transforms fragrance into feeling — from the thrill of rebellion to the calm of self-assurance.
            Beyond the visuals, the website was designed as a sensory digital playground where motion, sound, and storytelling merge. Users are invited to explore not just perfumes, but personas — discovering which scent matches their mood, their day, and their voice. The interface encourages exploration, echoing the idea that perfume is not a luxury reserved for the few but a form of self-expression for everyone.
            In an industry long defined by restraint, +91 Perfumes stands out as a celebration of boldness and belonging. IVAMO Studios helped craft not just a brand but a movement — one that turns perfume into personality, making luxury both relatable and proudly Indian.`,

        about: `RAF Clothing was conceived as a brand where style meets precision, and quality is never compromised. Founder Rafat Kazi envisioned an online presence that could communicate the sophistication of the label while making global fashion accessible at a click. The challenge was to transform an e-commerce store into an experience that feels curated, intentional, and aspirational — a digital runway for modern shoppers.

                IVAMO Studios partnered with RAF Clothing to design a fully Shopify-powered website that elevates both presentation and interaction. Every element of the UI and UX was crafted to reflect the brand’s elegance, from browsing collections to completing a purchase. The visual identity extends across digital touchpoints, presenting a cohesive aesthetic that balances minimalism with modern flair.

                The website is more than a transactional platform; it is a curated showcase. Clean layouts, strategic photography, and thoughtful motion create a sense of rhythm and movement akin to a runway presentation. Each interaction — scrolling, hovering, or exploring product details — reinforces the sophistication and style at the core of RAF Clothing.

                Through this digital transformation, RAF Clothing now stands as a globally accessible brand that marries aesthetic refinement with seamless functionality. The store is not only a place to shop but a stage for the brand’s narrative, allowing customers worldwide to experience fashion as intended: stylish, confident, and curated.`,

        about: `IVAMO Studios partnered with the creative collective formerly known as Moonray to guide its transformation into Chorus — a new identity that unites fashion, art, and experiential design within one expressive universe.
        This evolution marked a significant moment for the brand. What began as a clothing label rooted in craft and consciousness expanded into a multidisciplinary movement that celebrates collaboration and collective creation. The new name, Chorus, reflects this shift — a convergence of voices, ideas, and forms that harmonize into something greater than their parts.
        The process was deeply collaborative. Working closely with the founders, our team built the digital and visual foundation for Chorus from the ground up. The objective was to preserve Moonray’s artisanal soul while creating a broader world where texture, motion, and narrative could coexist. Every design decision was shaped by the tension between fluidity and structure, restraint and expression.
        The new web experience embodies that philosophy. It moves like a piece of performance art — each scroll, transition, and interaction choreographed to feel organic and alive. The UI and UX systems were crafted to merge storytelling and commerce seamlessly, allowing garments, art objects, and installations to be presented as part of a unified narrative rather than separate offerings.
        Visual language played a central role in defining this identity. Minimal compositions and soft, immersive color palettes echo the tactile sensibility of handmade materials, while subtle animations evoke the rhythm of breath and movement. The typography, both grounded and lyrical, ties together the brand’s evolving creative landscape.
        Through this transformation, IVAMO Studios helped Chorus find its new voice — one that is open, expressive, and collective. The result is not just a digital rebrand, but the creation of a living platform for art, fashion, and experience to converge.`,

        about: `INIT is a perfume house that exists between memory and imagination. Its fragrances are letters to the self — intimate, emotional, and deeply personal. The brand was conceived not as a commodity but as an experience: a pause in the day, a moment of remembrance, a rush of emotion. Each scent is an invitation to explore identity, memory, and desire, giving form to feelings that linger just beneath consciousness.

                IVAMO Studios partnered with INIT to bring this philosophy to life through a complete packaging overhaul and website revamp. The goal was to create a digital and physical presence that mirrors the poetry of the fragrances themselves — elegant, sensory, and atmospheric. The packaging was designed to reflect a modern, summery Italian sensibility: sunlit palettes, tactile materials, and refined structural details that evoke warmth, sophistication, and emotional resonance.

                The website redesign translates this ethos into digital form. It embraces a slow, intentional rhythm, allowing visitors to explore scents and stories with clarity and delight. Subtle motion, immersive imagery, and considered typography create a space that feels as personal as opening a letter. Every interaction is designed to reinforce the intimacy of the experience, connecting users to the brand’s narrative of self-reflection and exploration.

                Through this transformation, INIT now lives as a complete sensory universe. Packaging, web, and story converge to make fragrance more than a product — it becomes a lived emotional experience, a pause to reflect, and an invitation to inhabit one’s inner world.`,

This ambition marked the beginning of R Comfort’s evolution into the luxury segment.

        IVAMO Studios was entrusted with this transformation from the ground up. The project extended far beyond design — it was about shaping a new identity for a first-generation entrepreneur stepping into a world of refined branding and storytelling. Every element, from tone to typography, was crafted to articulate a sense of sophistication while honoring the authenticity that defines the brand’s roots.

        The new identity reflects modern comfort and timeless design. Soft tones and tactile imagery bring out the warmth of natural materials, while a restrained layout language highlights craftsmanship and detail. The visual system draws inspiration from the textures of wood and fabric, translating them into a digital experience that feels elegant yet approachable.
